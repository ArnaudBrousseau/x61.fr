## Who's This Book For?
"Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja" is designed for intermediate to advanced
JavaScript programmers. It expects that you already have a firm understanding
of JavaScript and a working knowledge of HTML/CSS.  
The strength of this book lies in its ability to force you to
revisit concepts most JS programmers (including myself) always take for
granted. It puts the focus on functions as objects, function invoking, closures,
cross-browsers strategies, etc.

Resig sets the tone pretty early on. After a short introduction in a chapter
titled "Arming With Testing And Debugging" he tells us about the importance of
testing and goes on to explain how we can create a very simple JavaScript
`assert` method and its associated test runner. Considerations like this
are usually briefly mentioned towards the end of a textbook. Not this time.

Reasons I'm writing about reading "Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja":

1. Writing about something helps you remember it better
2. I'm adding some reference and extra information here and there.
3. Hopefully this is useful to you, the reader, to a) get a sense of what's in
   this book and b) get better at JavaScript!

## Functions

Created via the `Function` constructor, functions are special objects with
one superpower: they can be **invoked**. Besides that, functions are object and
nothing but objects:

- they're created via literals `function <optionalName> (<optionalArguments) {<functionBody>}`
- can be assigned to variables or properties
- can be passed as function parameters and returned as function results
- can have properties and method (for instance, each function has a `name`
  property and a `call` and `apply` method)

### Function Declaration
The difference between

    function blah() { console.log('called'); }

and

    var blah = function() { console.log('called'); };
    sdfsd

In both cases, the function can be called via `blah()`. However, there's a
crucial difference: in the first case, the function is **named** `blah` which
means the function will be assigned a property `name` with the value `blah`.  
In the second case, we're assigning an **anonymous** function to the variable
`blah`. The function's `name` property in this case will be `''`.

### Arguments and Invocation
`this` and `arguments` are implicit parameters passed to every function. They
are just that. Parameters. The difference between `this`, `arguments` and
standard function parameters is that they are _implicit_. You won't see them in
 function signatures but they'll be available from within function bodies.

#### Arguments
`arguments` represent a list of all arguments passed to a function. It has
array-like accessors (`arguments[i]`) and properties (`arguments.length`) but
**is not an array** (`arguments.slice(1)` fails for instance).  
How can you get around that?

    Object.prototype.toString.call
    Array.prototype.slice.call
    etc

#### Invoking a function, and `this`
`this` is defined as the **function context**. Available within a function body,
`this` should really be referred to as  **invocation context**, because its value
varies based on the way a function is invoked:

- as a function, `this` refers to the global context `window`
- as a method, `this` refers to the object owning it
- as a constructor, `this` refers to the newly created object
- via `call` or `apply`, `this` is passed in and can be what we want

### Referencing Functions
Referencing functions from within themselves is necessary to achieve recursion.
Resig enumerates four ways.

First option: through a named function. Nothing out of the ordinary.

    function fact(x) {
        if (x !== 1) {
            return x * fact(x - 1);
        } else {
            return 1;
        }
    };

Second option: through a method name. Note the danger: if we decide to change
that method's name to `newfact`, we'll have to remember to change the inner
reference to `this.newfact`.

    var math = {
        'fact': function (x) {
            if (x !== 1) {
                return x * this.fact(x - 1);
            } else {
                return 1;
            }
        }
    };

Third option: through inline name. This addresses the shortcoming of the
previous solution.

    var math = {
        'fact': function myfact(x) {
            if (x !== 1) {
                return x * myfact(x - 1);
            } else {
                return 1;
            }
        }
    };

Last option: `callee` (going to go away in later versions of JS, use sparingly).

    var math = {
        'fact': function (x) {
            if (x !== 1) {
                return x * arguments.callee(x - 1);
            } else {
                return 1;
            }
        }
    };

### Auto-Memoizing Functions
Memoizing by using the object nature of functions:

    function getElements(name) {
        if (!getElements.cache) { getElements.cache = {}; }
        return getElements.cache[name] =
            getElements.cache[name] ||
            document.getElementsByTagName(name);
    };

You can easily guess how useful these techniques are in a library like
jQuery (actually, probably more in Sizzle, jQuery's DOM access library).

### Function Overloading
Functions have a `length` property, which corresponds to the number of
arguments declared in their signature. By comparing `fn.length` and
`arguments.length`, function overloading can be implemented in a cool way:

    function addMethod(object, name, fn) {
        var old = object[name];
        object[name] = function() {
            if (fn.length == arguments.length) {
                return fn.apply(this, arguments);
            } else if (typeof old === 'function') {
            return old.apply(this, arguments);
            }
        };
    };

    // Overloading then becomes a piece of cake. Pretty neat right?
    var obj = {};
    addMethod(obj, 'method', function() { /* do something */ });
    addMethod(obj, 'method', function(a) { /* do something with a */ });
    addMethod(obj, 'method', function(a, b) { /* do something with a and b */ });

## Closures
Closures are probably one of the most confusing concepts when someone with a
classical object-oriented background comes to JavaScript. Resig's definition of
it: **closures allow a function to access all the variables, as well as other
functions, that are in scope when the function itself is declared.**  
Later in the chapter: **That's what closures are all about. They create a
"safety bubble," if you will, of the function and the variables that are in
scope at the point of the function's declaration [...] This "bubble,"
containing the function and its variables, stays around as long as the function
itself does.**

Let's look at some code samples to go over the main use cases for closures.

### Private variables
    function Counter() {
        var count = 0; // visibility limited to Counter's inner scope
        this.increment = function() { count++; }
        this.getCount = function() { return count; }
    };
    // Can't view/modify count from here. You have to go through Counter.getCount()

## Timers
JavaScript is _single-threaded_. That's really important to understand. Once
you grasp the fact that the browser has no choice but to queue handlers when
events are firing at the same time, understanding why timers cannot be reliable
is easy.

Browser APIs are well known: `window.setTimeout` and `window.setInterval` to
create timers, `window.clearTimeout` and `window.clearInterval` to clear them.

Nifty trick for all browsers and IE > 9: timer functions can take arguments!
Like so: `window.setInterval(myfunction, 100, arg1, arg2)`

There's a difference between:

    # Executes `fn` every 10ms by calling setInterval once
    window.setInterval(fn, 10);

and:

    # Executes `fn` every 10ms by calling setTimeout over and over
    window.setTimeout(function fn() {
        window.setTimeout(fn, 10)
    }, 10);

Second version is guaranteed to run every 10ms or more.  
First version will try to execute every 10ms regardless of what happened before.

Cutting expensive computation into manageable chunks is an interesting
application of timers. Instead of doing a 100% of the work in a big chunk you
can choose to schedule manageable chunk via `setTimeout` thus enabling the
browser to do some work after each chunk finishes and before the next one
begins. Say a click event happens during a computation: the browser would get
a chance to execute the associated handler right after the current chunk is
done as opposed to waiting until the end of the whole computation.

Timers are also super useful to build asynchronous test suites and centralized
timers.  
The idea is to have a single timer handling a queue (of tests to run or of
animations/functions to execute) so that the browser is not overwhelmed by
multiple timers. This centralized timer technique guarantees order of
execution. That's a perk we don't get when we use multiple timers.

## With Statement
There is a whole chapter about JavaScript's `with` statement. I honestly don't
think it deserved a whole chapter in this book.

There are two pieces of information I got from it.  
First one is that `with` is going away in ES5 strict mode. It's considered
harmful mainly because you can read from and write to the global scope
inadvertently.  
Second thing is that Firebug (and probably other devtools too) uses `with` in a
beautiful fashion to create the web console's execution context â™¥

    eval("with(__scope__.vars) {" +
        "with(__scope__.api) {" + 
            "with(__scope__.userVars) {" +
                "with(window) {" +
                    someUserCode +
                "}}}}");

## Cross Browser Strategies
Authoring cross-browser JavaScript is hard. Resig names 5 major concerns:

- Browser bugs
- Browser bug fixes
- Missing browser features
- External code
- Browser regressions

Some strategies/advices to deal with browser bugs/differences:

- encapsulate your code into its own closure/unit, expose it as little as possible
- degrade gracefully when features aren't available and/or bugs arise
- "Safe cross-browser fixes": no feature detection, no side effects. Example:
  ignoring negative width/height value: `if ((key == 'width' || key ==
  'height') && parseFloat(value) < 0) { value = undefined; }`. This makes the
  buggy browser's API comply with the standard. It's a Good Thing Â®
- "Object detection": feature detection by inspecting a property/value of an
  object. Example: bind event with W3C's `addEventListener` vs Microsoft's
  `attachEvent`.
- "Feature simulation": create and execute a reduced test case to isolate the
  buggy behavior. That creates a toggle to work around the bug in our code.
  Very often that feature simulation is executed once at load time to minimize
  performance impact.

Interestingly enough Resig gives a list of "untestable" browser issues:

- Event handler bindings (no way to determine if a handler has been bound or not)
- Event firing (no way to check if an event has been or will fire)
- CSS property effects (does it affect appearance)
- Browser crashes (if a feature makes the browser crash, feature simulation will too)
- API performance (prohibitively expensive to test)
- AJAX issues (tricky and expensive to test)

## DOM Attributes and Properties
There is an incredible amount of quirks involved in getting/setting DOM
attributes and properties. Ways to get properties/attributes of DOM nodes:

- `elem.propertyName`
- `elem.getAttribute('attributeName')`
- `elem.getAttributeNode('attributeName').nodeValue` (recommanded way to get
  the unaltered value)

Note that attribute and property names aren't always the same. For instance
`class` is a valid attribute name but the associated property is `className`
The other ones are `for`, `readonly`, `maxlength`, `cellspacing`, `rowspan`,
`colspan`, `tabindex` which match respectively to the property names `htmlFor`,
`readOnly`, `maxLength`, `cellSpacing`, `rowSpan`, `colSpan`, `tabIndex`.)

Major quirks that Resig talks about:

- Form input's `id`/`name` attributes are transferred on the form DOM node as
  properties.  For instance if you have an input element with an `id`/`name`
  attribute set to `foo`, `myForm.foo` will yield a reference this input.  Now
  let's say you have an input with its `name`/`id` attribute set to `action`.
  See the problem? Form element's original `action` property will be lost :/
- `href`, `src` or `action` perform URL normalization (you get a full canonical
  URL when you might expect a relative URL)
- input `type` attribute can't be changed after DOM node is inserted (IE only)
- more problems around the `style` attribute: measuring width/height, getting
  color, opacity or pixel measures. One interesting API: `getComputedStyle` (or IE's `currentStyle`) gives you the active CSS
  property/value pairs for an element.
