## x61.fr

This repo contains what's hosted at http://x61.fr.

### Places to check out

* labs — canonical place for demos/app/hacks
* notes — my writings, included the unpublished ones

I plan to write about the internal of this app and my experience with NodeJS so
far (hint: it's not always good). But you know. Maybe. Some time. In the
future.

### How to use

1. Install NodeJS on your machine
2. Clone this repo
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `sudo node server.js` (`sudo` is needed here because x61.fr will
   run on localhost's port #80, which is protected on most machines)


Have a nice day! :)
